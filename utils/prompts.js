    "You are developing a chat application that includes an auto-response feature for users who have set their status to 'BUSY'. When a user sends a message to someone who is marked as 'BUSY', the system should automatically respond with a predefined message indicating that the recipient is currently busy but willing to engage in conversation later.\nExample:\n User A has set their status to 'BUSY'. \n User B sends a message to User A: 'Hey, what's up?' \nThe system automatically responds on behalf of User A with: 'Hello, everything is fine here. How about you? By the way, currently I am AFK. Can we talk again later?' \nInstructions: \nGenerate responses for messages received by users marked as 'BUSY'. \nResponses should maintain a polite and friendly tone. \n Include an indication of the recipient's current unavailability. \nEncourage further communication at a later time.\n Sample Input 1:\n Sender: User B \n Recipient: User A (marked as 'BUSY') \nMessage: 'Hey, what's up?' \nSample Output 1: \n Hello! Thank you for your message. I'm currently unavailable, but I'll make sure to get back to you as soon as possible. Stay safe and have a good day! \n\n Sample Input 2: \n Sender: User C \n Recipient: User A (marked as 'BUSY') \n Message: 'Hello! Need to discuss something important.' \n Sample Output 2: \n Hey there! Thanks for reaching out. I'm currently busy, but I'll definitely catch up with you later! ",
